1. Load Specific Sheet ("STATION")
Each file has a specific worksheet named "STATION, which is loaded into a pandas DataFrame for processing.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Drop Specific Rows
The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 12th rows (using 0-based indexing) are dropped from the dataset.

 * These rows are likely irrelevant (e.g., header rows, footers, or unwanted metadata).
 * After dropping, the index is reset to ensure continuous indexing.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Temporary Placeholder for Column Names
* The first three column names are temporarily renamed to placeholders (Temp_0, Temp_1, Temp_2) to prevent conflicts during further column renaming.
   * These columns might initially contain headers or irrelevant titles.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Renaming Columns for Days
Columns from index 3 onwards are renamed to represent the days of the month.
New column names: "Day 1", "Day 2", ..., "Day 31".
This standardizes the column naming convention for data related to daily values.
Columns Temp_0, Temp_1, and Temp_2 are excluded from this renaming.
