1. Load Specific Sheet ("STATION")
Each file has a specific worksheet named "STATION, which is loaded into a pandas DataFrame for processing.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Drop Specific Rows
The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 12th rows (using 0-based indexing) are dropped from the dataset.

These rows are likely irrelevant (e.g., header rows, footers, or unwanted metadata).
After dropping, the index is reset to ensure continuous indexing.
